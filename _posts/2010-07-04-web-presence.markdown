My projects at <http://github.com/catenate> include **rwhaskell**, Haskell  
programs implementing chapter exercises in *Real World Haskell*;  
**pnblic**, a public notebook; and **tictestrue**, a test-driven tic-tac-toe  
program in Ruby managed by a kanban board and Pivotal Tracker.  

I also write at [Stack Overflow] [so], <http://twitter.com/catenate>, and  
<http://swtools.wordpress.com>.
